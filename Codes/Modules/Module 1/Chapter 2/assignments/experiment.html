        <ol  style="margin-left :50px ;">
                <li>We are very fortunate to be born a country which is blessed with rich soil, diversified climate, many rivers and the great Himalayas where almost all varieties of fruits, vegetables and cereals, etc. can be grown. In ancient times, the land was in abundance, the supply of food was more than the demand and people used fresh food materials in most natural form.</li>
                <li>The population spurt in our country has given rise to unemployment and poverty. The demand for food has increased & our country has to import food grains, oil etc. from other countries. This shortage of food and ignorance of consumers is the main cause for adulteration of foodstuffs by the unscrupulous traders. It has become so common that the consumers have to run from pillars to pillars to get a foodstuff which is not adulterated.</li>
                <li>The consumers are not aware of hazards of adulteration and pay heavily for consuming adulterated food. If the consumer knows the ways and means to check the commodities of daily use, they can save themselves and there families from this mind - boggling problem.</li>

        <h4  style="margin-left :50px ;">1. Adulteration of various insoluble substance in sugar</h4>
        <ol style="margin-left :50px ;">
               <li> A small amount of sugar was taken in a test tube and shaken with little water. `Pure sugar` dissolved in water but insoluble impurities didnâ€™t dissolve.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4  style="margin-left :50px ;">2. Adulteration of chalk powder, washing soda in sugar</h4>
        <ol style="margin-left :50px ;">
            <li> To a small amount of sugar in a test tube , few drops of <i>diluted Hcl</i> were added. A brisk effervescence of <b>carbon dioxide</b> confirmed the presence of chalk powder or washing soda in the given sample of sugar</li>

            <ul>
                <li>The increasing number of food producers and the out standing amounts of imported food stuffs enables the producers to mislead and cheat consumers. To differentiate of those who take advantage of legal rules from the once who commit food adulteration is very difficult. The consciousness of consumers has become very crucial. However, how can we expect consequent behavior from them regarding controversial issues emerging day by day? In addition, ignorance and unfair market behaviors is endangering consumer health. So we need sanctions and judicial penalties with adequate restaning force to halt this process.</li>
